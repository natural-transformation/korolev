                |elegant. As is often the case, a beautiful idea confronted
                |reality, and after a few years, browser manufacturers added
                |support for a scripting language. At first, it was intended
                |only for decorating. Until the middle of the first decade,

                |Tasks to improve interactivity fell on the shoulders of
                |template designers. Often they do not have the competence
                |and authority to develop a "cross-cutting" solution.
                |Template designers have learned JS and became front-end
                |engineers. The logic gradually began to flow from the
                |server to the client. It's convenient for the frontend-guy
                |to write everything on the client side. For the backend-guy,
                |it's convenient not to think about the user. "I'll give
                |you JSON, and then I don't care" -- they say. Two years
                |ago, serverless architecture became popular. The suggestion
